<p>Cascading Style Sheets are quite simply a gem in the crown of web development.<br> However, in order to get the most out of them they need to be used porperly.<br>
CSS is a language that describes the style of an HTML document.<br> CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.</p>
<p>The benefits of using an external style sheet are:
<ul>
<li>everything is stored within a single file.</li>
<li>once changed/updated, the changes are reflected on all other pages that reference the stylesheet.</li>
<li>this makes it easier to maintain larger websites.</li>
<li>pages load quicker once the main CSS file has been cached.</li>
<li>as a result bandwidth goes down.</li>
<li>effectively, you’re able to change the entire look and feel of a website through a single file.</li>
</ul>
